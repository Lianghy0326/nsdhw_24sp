# DE
Automatic Differential Equation Solver Optimizer


## Basic Information
Github Repository: https://github.com/Lianghy0326/DE


Design an intelligent C++ solver that automatically selects the optimal solving method for differential equation (DE) problems. 
The solver should choose the best integration method and step size based on problem characteristics to 
maximize solving speed and accuracy.

## Problem to Solve
The goal is to develop an intelligent solver capable of automatically selecting 
the most suitable solving method for DE problems. This involves analyzing problem 
characteristics such as initial conditions, boundary conditions, and equation forms 
to determine the appropriate integration method and optimization strategies. 
By doing so, we aim to maximize solving speed and accuracy, addressing the 
challenges of efficiently solving DE problems.

## Prospective Users
- Researchers and engineers in fields utilizing DEs for modeling and simulation.
